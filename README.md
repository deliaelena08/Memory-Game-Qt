A simple memory matching game developed using C++ and Qt framework. The game features a grid of hidden tiles with values that need to be matched by the player. Players click on tiles, and if they match, they stay visible. The game tracks the number of clicks made and stores the player's name in a Hall of Fame once all pairs are found. Aimed to practice the use of Qt for creating interactive applications and handling basic game logic.
